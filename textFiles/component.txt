----------------- ANGULAR COMPONENT -------------------

1. component is like and seperate html like file in angular.

2. conponent has Data , HTML-template , Logic in ng

3. component is help us to creat reusable component

4. in ng it always contains app as an root component for ng

5. we can set our own component for root component in ng

6. dom changes in ng how ng updates the dom based on the logic. ng perfomance based on ng dom update

7. ng update the dom changes faster,and how precise we seperate our component it will boost ng perfomance.


-----------------  HOW COMPONENTS WORKS ? -------------

1. app.ts --> contains the logic for the component.

2. app.css , app.html ---> contains css and html template file for the logic

3. app.spec.ts --> used while testing the component.

4. app.config.ts --> root filefor the app component. and routes.ts contains app routes.
   in newest version app.module.ts not used , it uses imoprts of the component decorator.

5. component decorator handles the component related works , selector holds the where the component 
   should render. templateUrl , styleUrls , imports contains html cnd css file path. webpack inject the 
   essential js file or ng nd it start the ng server.

----------------------- HOW TO CREATE COMPONENTS ------------------------

     1. CLI easy way
     2. Mannual Way likely hard way

2. Mannual Way to create an component
  1. first create an component decorator and related file and component class and export component class.
  2. selector name followed by root component name eg:app-my-component
  3. in ng uses PascalCase. component class name MyTestcomponent.
  4. then we need to import the component in root component decorator imports prop.
  5. bootstrap prop tells the which component should i load first.

1. CLI Way
  1. ng generate component component-name || ng g c component-name
