---------------------- ANGULAR DATA BINDING --------------

1. data binding mean how the data in the component and the template view shared.

2. there are two ways of the DB
   1. one way --> each other doesnot know the changes in the data. in defaul ng data binding are one way. 
   2. two way --> each other knows the changes in the data

3. we can use {{variable-name}} --> to show the data in template view or we can bind the data 
   by prop binding. <my-component [elementDomProp]="variable-name". {{}} --> string interpolation

4. the above method we bind the data using our component. we can bind data in view we use event binding.

5. In two way binding data changes reflect in both side. in ng that is acheived by ngModule. 
   if we use directive in ng we need to import , import formsModule from ng.

6. for two data binding [(ngModel)] = "variabble-name"
