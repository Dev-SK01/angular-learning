--------------------- SIGNALS IN NG -----------

1. Signals are like react use state, it will help us to manage the states.

2. signal() --> used to create an signal.

3. computed(variables() + 1) --> helps to computed the state changes using the signal state.

4. variable.set() --> set the new state. we need to call signal variable as variable()

5. it reduce the code of RxJs and observables.
