---------------- DATA SHARING BETWEEN COMPOENENT ------------

1. we can  share the data parent to child or child to parent

2. we use Input(variable name) to get an input from parent. P -> C

3. <child [variable-name]='data'><child> --> here we share the data to child.

4. Output() C -> P, this decorator has event emitter to tell the parent data changed

5. @Output eventName:EventEmitter<type of the data> = new emitter; 

6. this.eventName.emit(this.data) --> emit the data to parent.

7. <parent (eventName) = "eventtCallback($event)"
